  em_int.c, em_rmu.c and em_burtc.c copied manually from C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v2\developer\sdks\efm32\v2\emlib\src
  Why weren't they here already?
  Also: Comparing another file here to the one in directory above: One is copyrighted Energy Micro, one Silicon Labs.
  Where did the Energy Micro file originally come from?
